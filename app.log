Since there was a greeting in both the initial message and the subsequent one, I returned them unchanged per your instructions for greetings. Let me know if any other questions or tasks come up!

I hope this meets all of your requirements - please let me clarify further should anything be unclear about my approach here:

1) The original messages were "Hello" (in each case).
2) As they are simple greetings with no actual content/question beyond being polite salutations,
3) Per instruction 6 ("If the user greets you, return their query unchanged"),  
4) No changes/reword

However, since "Hello" or similar greetings are typically used for salutations rather than posing a specific inquiry, there isn't really an underlying 'question' in this context requiring further clarification beyond acknowledging receipt of greeting intent from User (which would be returning same). 

If we must treat even such casual openings formally though - treating them hypothetically like they were leading into some unstated but implied request:

"What can I assist with today?"

But again note above goes well past what was actually asked; original should suffice unless more detail follows later indicating otherwise unmet informational needs behind initial contact attempt by human
